applying-smoothing-curse is base code + smoothing curve function. The output graph is smoothed.  

calculateangle.py calculates angle when a,b,c are given. We are instersted in the angle that ba and bc makes. For example, if a = shoudler position, b = elbow position, c = wrist position, calculateangle.py calculates the angles that elbow-shoulder and elbow-wrist vector makes.
